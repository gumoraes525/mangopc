# Mango68k Roadmap

## v0.1: Macintosh 128K Emulation Baseline
- [ ] Refactor codebase from PowerPC to Motorola 68K CPU architecture
- [ ] Minimal CPU core implementation (68K/68000)
- [ ] Mac 128K ROM loading and validation
- [ ] 128K RAM and video memory mapping
- [ ] Basic I/O (keyboard, mouse)
- [ ] Floppy disk (400KB) emulation
- [ ] Simple debugger or logging facility

## v0.2: Additional Early Macs
- [ ] 512K/512Ke/Plus support (RAM, ROM differences)
- [ ] SCSI device stubs

## v0.3: Toward a Usable System
- [ ] Improved CPU instruction coverage
- [ ] Sound and extended video hardware
- [ ] More accurate peripherals
- [ ] Bugfixes and usability improvements

## Long-Term Goals
- [ ] Expand to later 68K models (SE, SE/30, Classic, II series, etc.)
- [ ] Modular component framework for new hardware support
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Advanced features (snapshots, save states, GUI)

# Mango68k

_Mango68k is an experimental emulator for classic Apple Macintosh computers based on the Motorola 68K CPU family, forked from the PearPC project. Its initial goal is to accurately emulate the Macintosh 128K, with a roadmap to support the full range of 68K-based Macs._

---

## Project Status

This project is in its early stages. The current codebase is a fork of [PearPC](https://github.com/pearpc/pearpc), reoriented towards Motorola 68K Mac emulation, starting with the Macintosh 128K.

## Goals

- Emulate the Motorola 68000 (68K) CPU core
- Support hardware and system architecture specific to the Macintosh 128K
- Provide accurate ROM and floppy disk emulation for early Macintosh systems
- Expand support to other 68K-based Macs (Mac 512K, Plus, SE, Classic, etc.)

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for detailed plans.

## Why fork PearPC?

PearPC is a mature PowerPC emulator with a modular architecture, providing a strong foundation for CPU and peripheral emulation. Mango68k builds on this by targeting the earlier 68K architecture and classic Mac hardware.

## How to Build

Instructions for building Mango68k will be provided as development progresses.
